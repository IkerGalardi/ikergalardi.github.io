      <description>Journey to first completed project With this article I will describe the journey of creating an application to create other applications… kinda crazy right! It really isn’t. What LMake is resembles more to what GNU Make is than to what a compiler is.
The project started with another project, an operating system! Not many people have tried to build operating systems but those who did try know that the building and linking process differs a bit from standard applications.</description>
