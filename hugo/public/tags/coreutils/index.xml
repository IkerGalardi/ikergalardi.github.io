      <description>Introduction At university we had an introduction to operating systems course where we basically learnt how basic unix utilities like cat, ls, etc, worked by programming them in C using the unix API.
This course was kind of mind blowing as I never touched such low level APIs, and kind of broke the illusion that system&amp;rsquo;s programming involves some kind of black magic and Einstein level brainpower. So with this article series I want to re-remember those lessons in the hopes that someone can also break that barrier to learning this kind of low level stuff.</description>
