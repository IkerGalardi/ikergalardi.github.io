      <description>Rendering adventures I’ve always been amazed with computer graphics, and looking at recent advancements with ray tracing, and the great upgrade that Unreal Engine 4 supposed over Unreal Engine 3 with the physically based rendering (PBR from now on) work flow made me more curious.
I had tried before GPU accelerated rendering with OpenGL, but I had never advanced more than a textured quad, so 2021’s summer was the time to finally tackle this curiosity with a own built PBR renderer written in C++ and vulkan.</description>
